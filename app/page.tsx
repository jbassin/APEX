            APEX is a tabletop roleplaying game about the Thessians, a race of
            eldritch beings. As Thessians, the players fight and scheme to bring
            about their world-spanning plans, whether this involves conquering
            the universe, building a utopia, or simply exploring the reaches of
            the unknown. This ruleset encourages narrative-heavy, one-shot style
            play. You'll need thirteen ten-sided dice (13d10), a completed
            character sheet, and somewhere to track your character's resources
            to participate.

          <H1>Playing the Game</H1>
          <p>
            A game of APEX involves <B>players</B>, who control{" "}
            <B>player characters</B> (<I>PCs</I>), and a <B>narrator</B> who
            controls all other characters (<I>NPCs</I>) and sets the scene
            during play. Typical play cedes decision-making to the players, who
            determine their PC's actions and what activities to pursue. Given
            the overwhelming power of the PCs in this game, most actions require
            no adjudication on the narrator's part and occur without any dice
            rolls.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Should a player want to do something unlikely to fail—ranging
            anywhere from throwing a rock a few hundred yards to flying,
            changing their form, or consuming mundane poison—the narrator will
            give the player the go-ahead to describe the action (or describe it
            themselves, if the player prefers).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Dice rolls, and APEX's <B>dice pool</B> mechanic, only come into
            play when a PC attempts an action that has a chance to fail. This
            may include challenging tasks or actions that another character may
            contest. To resolve such occurrences, every PC has nine{" "}
            <B>abilities</B> that cover different kinds of actions and three{" "}
            <B>approaches</B> associated with those abilities.

        <Right>
          <H2>Approaches and Abilities</H2>
          <p>
            An approach is how a PC attempts to perform some action. APEX
            categorizes approaches into three general categories: {ps}, {ph},
            and {po}. A {ps} approach means a PC emphasizes using their mind and
            forethought, a {ph} approach means the PC relies more on their
            physical body, and a {po} approach means the PC uses their magic
            more directly.
          </p>
          <br />
          <Card>
            As an example: <I>Tracker</I> wants to locate a runaway thrall. If{" "}
            <I>Tracker</I> hid a trace on the thrall before it escaped, she'd
            use a {po} approach. If <I>Tracker</I> went looking for footprints
            or broken branches, she'd use a {ph} approach. If <I>Tracker</I>{" "}
            imagined how the thrall might act and attempted to predict its
            movements, she'd use a {ps} approach.
          </Card>
          <br />
          <p>
            The nine abilities are the broad categories a particular action can
            fall into and are used to describe the skill a PC has in that kind
            of action. Abilities are associated with a specific approach in
            groupings of three per approach.

            {cmp}. <I>Stay calm under adversity. Withstand other wills.</I> A
            PC's {cmp} is its ability to shrug off attempts to control or
            influence its actions and how well it can convincingly misdirect
            others. Some examples that use the {cmp} ability are avoiding being
            stunned by an EMP and convincing an inquisitor of your innocence.

          <br />

            {ret}. <I>Convince those around you. Tempt the unwilling.</I> A PC's{" "}
            {ret} is its ability to manipulate others and persuade them into
            actions in the PC's favor. Some examples that use the {ret} ability
            are tricking a noble into exposing his secrets in a high court and
            luring the son of the technocrat into hedonic life of sin.

            {wit}. <I>Uncover new knowledge. Remember hidden truths.</I> A PC's{" "}
            {wit} is its ability to recall and learn information. Some examples
            that use the {wit} ability are learning the true name of a formless
            anomaly on the rim, distributing esoteric truths to mortals in
            exchange for favors, and remembering the correct lever sequence to
            launch a slipship.

            <I>Withstand great pressure. Struggle against the impossible.</I> A
            PC's {end} is its ability to push through hostile environments,
            shrug off poisoning attempts, and exert itself over long periods.
            Some examples that use the {end} ability are descending into the
            heart of a singularity and holding a continent above the ocean for
            millennia.

            {agi}. <I>React to new circumstances. Move with haste.</I>A PC's{" "}
            {agi} is its ability to move with speed and grace. Some examples
            that use the {agi} ability are slicing a paladin in half before he
            can draw his blade and piloting an imperial starcraft through a
            dense asteroid field.

            {pwr}. <I>Shift people and worlds. Apply intense force.</I> A PC's{" "}
            {pwr} is its ability to exert pressure on objects or command fear
            and respect among its followers. Some examples that use the {pwr}{" "}
            ability are shattering an ancient "unbreakable" artifact and
            swinging a lightblade through a large moon.

            {shv}. <I>Tune in to the Aether. Feel the world around you.</I> A
            PC's {shv} is its ability to perceive the world around it and the
            effect technology or magic has on reality. Some examples that use
            the {shv} ability are seeking the location of the last rebels in
            their underground base and tracing the flow of mana in a broken
            magicircuit.

          <p>
            {vol}. <I>Manifest your will. Create something from nothing.</I> A
            PC's {vol} is its ability to generate or destroy matter and energy.
            Some examples that use the {vol} ability are summoning a ball of
            fire in the middle of a priest's convocation and consuming the
            nuclear force in a burgeoning people's space station.

          <p>
            {int}. <I>Manipulate complex systems. Speak with machines.</I> A
            PC's {int} is its ability to connect with magical mechanisms and
            intricate machines. Some examples that use the {int} ability are
            convincing an autonomous turret to fire on its creator and modifying
            a clock tower to summon fiends when it strikes midnight.

          <H2>Rolling and Resolving Actions</H2>
          <p>
            Each approach has one to three pips (⦿) associated with it,
            representing how good a PC is at a particular approach--with more
            pips being better. Similarly, each ability has one to six pips. When
            a PC attempts to perform an action that might fail (or succeed with
            consequences), the narrator asks them to perform an ability check.
            The narrator determines which approach and skill best fit the
            attempted action and sets the check's difficulty from two to nine.
            The player rolls a quantity of d10s equal to the approach's pips
            plus the ability's pips and counts the number of successes: the dice
            that rolled a six or higher. The action succeeds if the number of
            successes equals or exceeds the difficulty. If the number of
            successes is greater than half the difficulty, rounded down, the
            action partially succeeds or succeeds with consequences. Otherwise,
            the action fails.

            For example, <I>Anger</I> and <I>Despair</I> want to drive their
            captives to jump into the spike pit in their cell. <I>Despair</I>{" "}
            shows the captives scenes of their loved ones dying and their world
            melting in an attempt to rob them of their will to live. The
            narrator asks <I>Despair</I> to roll a {ps}(<Ps>⦿⦿</Ps>)+
            {ret}(<Ps>⦿⦿⦿</Ps>) roll and sets the difficulty at three.{" "}
            <I>Despair</I> has five pips between her approach and ability, so
            she rolls five dice. She gets two successes, which doesn't match the
            difficulty but passes the half mark; while some of the captives do
            self-impale, the rest bolster themselves against her words. Seeing
            this, <I>Anger</I> gets bored and teleports into the chamber, trying
            to throw the prisoners in one by one. The narrator asks <I>Anger</I>{" "}
            to roll a {ph}(<Ph>⦿⦿⦿</Ph>)+{pwr}(<Ph>⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿</Ph>) roll and keeps
            the difficulty at 3. <I>Anger</I> rolls nine dice and gets six
            successes. As such, he successfully throws the remaining captives
            into the pit.

          <p>
            A Thessian is powerful enough that the prospect of killing one is
            nigh impossible and, as such, cannot occur during a typical session
            of APEX. Death is not the only possible negative outcome, however.{" "}
            <Hp>Coherence loss</Hp> renders a PC immobile, unable to act until
            aided by an ally. Fortunately, the great power in a Thessian's
            physical form can be harnessed in a potent final burst when a PC
            falls, causing beneficial effects unique to each character (as
            detailed later in this document).

          <H2>
            <Ap>Action Points</Ap>
          </H2>
          <p>
            In addition to their {hp}, each Thessian has latent energy that they
            can harness to increase their natural ability. This energy is
            represented by <Ap>Action Points</Ap> ({ap}), which a PC can have
            2-10 of. In a session of APEX, a player may spend their {ap} on one
            of two things: they may <Ap>Push the Narrative</Ap>, or they may{" "}
            <Ap>Activate a Power</Ap>.
          </p>

            <Ap>Push the Narrative</Ap>
          </H3>
          <p>
            Whenever a player is asked to make an ability check, they may expend
            some of their {ap} to <Ap>Push the Narrative</Ap> and gain an edge.
            For each {ap} spent before the roll, the player may add one
            additional die to their dice pool. In exchange for this significant
            boost in ability, a PC strains the Narrative, causing it to rebound
            later in the session. For each {ap} spent in this fashion, the
            narrator gains their own {ap}, which may be used to empower
            adversaries encountered during play.

          <p>
            Each Thessian has a handful of <Ap>Powers</Ap> -- unique combat
            abilities that encourage varied playstyles and gameplay niches.
            During combat, players may spend an {ap} to activate one of their{" "}
            <Ap>Powers</Ap>. Spending an {ap} this way does not have a negative
            consequence like <Ap>Push the Narrative</Ap> might. The{" "}
            <Ap>Powers</Ap> available to your character are detailed in the
            character creation portion of this ruleset.

          <H3>Recovering Resources</H3>
          <p>
            There are a few ways to recover a PC's {hp} and {ap}. The simplest
            method to borrow from an ally: a Thessian may donate their resources
            to a close ally, though this will take time in combat. Also, a
            player may choose to convert their resources between the two pools
            at a 2:1 exchange rate. However, the most efficient way to replenish
            resources is to take them from others. Whenever a player slays a foe
            in combat, a d10 is rolled. If the die lands on a four, five, or
            six, they regain one {hp}. On a seven or above, they regain one {ap}
            . The last method to recover resources is on revival--if an ally
            aids an <Hp>incoherent</Hp> PC, they return to life with half their{" "}
            {hp} and {ap} rounded up.
          </p>
        </Left>
        <Right>
          <H1>Combat</H1>
          <p>
            Combat in APEX is structured into rounds and turns. When a round
            begins, all Thessians take a turn in any order they like. Once the
            PCs have gone, the enemies take their turns as one group. After the
            enemies complete their actions, a new round begins.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            During their turn, a PC can move and take one action. Movement in
            APEX is abstract--a target may be in one of three ranges. If the
            target is at most a few steps away, it's Close; if it's within 100
            feet, it's Near, and anything further than that is Far. During a
            turn, movement allows the PC to move one increment towards or away
            from a target.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            An action is anything a player chooses to do during their turn. This
            is typically <Ap>Activating a Power</Ap>, but if the player doesn't
            want to spend an {ap}, they can instead perform a{" "}
            <Ap>Freeform Action</Ap>: anything that might require an ability
            check. <Ap>Freeform Action</Ap> are less resource-intensive but have
            a chance to fail or backfire depending on the difficulty of the act.
            Besides those two options, a player may aid an <Hp>incoherent</Hp>{" "}
            companion and donate resources.
          </p>
          <br />
          <Card>
            <p>
              An example player round might look something like this:{" "}
              <I>Hunger</I>, <I>Honor</I>, and <I>Mania</I> are leveling the
              capital of a country that insulted them. <I>Honor</I> marks the
              general and one of the larger platoons with his passive{" "}
              <Ap>Power</Ap>, then spends an {ap} to swap the positions of{" "}
              <I>Mania</I> and an enemy tank, placing her right in the middle of
              combat. <I>Mania</I> spends an {ap} to force the enemy to fire
              upon itself, taking out two platoons at once, then leaps into the
              air to avoid enemy fire. She gets an <Hp>HP drop</Hp> and an{" "}
              <Ap>AP drop</Ap> from her two kills. <I>Hunger</I> wants to
              consume the nearest battle mech, which the narrator sets at a
              difficulty three {ph}(<Ph>⦿⦿</Ph>
              )+{end}(<Ph>⦿⦿⦿⦿</Ph>) check. <I>Hunger</I> rolls four successes
              and eats the mech. No drops are rolled from the battle mech.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The enemy response might look like this: The general and the
              larger platoon cannot act due to <I>Honor</I>'s mark, so they do
              nothing. A smaller platoon is still near <I>Mania</I>, so they
              unload their weapons and deal <Ha>1 Harm</Ha> to her. One of the
              battle mechs near <I>Hunger</I> detonates its energy core in a
              last-ditch effort to stop the Thessian. <I>Hunger</I> takes{" "}
              <Ha>2 Harm</Ha> and fails a difficulty two {ph}(<Ph>⦿⦿</Ph>
              )+{cmp}(<Ps>⦿</Ps>) check, losing an {ap} as a result.

          <H2>Portfolios</H2>
          <p>
            A Portfolio is a collection of powers that differentiates any
            Thessian from another. Each PC has one Portfolio, which will largely
            dictate the role that character has in combat. Each Portfolio has a
            passive power (which activates for free when certain conditions are
            met), four active powers, a Coherence Loss event, and a selection of
            17 specializations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Specializations are minor modifications a player can make to their
            character and are split into two categories: General specializations
            and Power specializations. General specializations apply to a
            Portfolio as a whole, while Power specializations are applied to a
            specific Power.
          </p>
        </Left>
        <Right>
          <H2>Building your Character</H2>
          <p>
            To begin building your PC, you must start with a theme. All
            Thessians have a theme or ideal that they represent and inherit
            their name from. This can be a kind of creature (<I>Dragon</I>,{" "}
            <I>Beast</I>, or <I>Angel</I>), a concept (<I>Archival</I> or{" "}
            <I>Endless Night</I>), or an emotion (<I>Hunger</I>,{" "}
            <I>Vainglory</I>, and <I>Monotony</I>).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Once you have your theme, it's time to select your resources. You
            start with <Hp>2 HP</Hp> and <Ap>2 AP</Ap>, and have eight points to
            distribute between the two of them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Next you select your Portfolio. Each Portfolio comes with a series
            of <Ap>Powers</Ap> and a selection of specializations. Select one,
            and four specializations from that Portfolio. If you choose any{" "}
            <Ap>Power</Ap> specializations, remember to choose which{" "}
            <Ap>Power</Ap> they apply to!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Finally, you make your ability scores: distribute your aptitudes,
            assign pips to abilities, and select a specialty. First is
            distributing aptitudes--every player character is excellent at one
            approach, good at a second approach, and okay at the third approach.
            Assign three pips to one, two to another, and one to a third. Next
            is assigning pips to abilities. Each character starts with one pip
            in every skill, and 18 free pips can be assigned to any ability. The
            maximum number of pips set to any one ability equals two plus the
            associated approach's number of pips. Finally, select a specialty.
            Every PC has one ability they're particularly good at. Add one pip
            onto any skill--this pip ignores the maximum limit from the previous
            step.

              For example: <I>Caregiver</I> likes to redeem her foes and take
              care of them even in their afterlife. She chooses a <Hp>8 HP</Hp>/
              <Ap>4 AP</Ap> split and the Grim Portfolio. She wants her thralls
              to be a little hardier, so she takes the Builder specialization.
              She wants to be able to command multiple thralls at a time, so she
              takes the Marionette specialization and applies it to her Puppet{" "}
              <Ap>Power</Ap>. She'd like to use Haunt often, so she takes the
              Efficient and Rallying Cry specializations as well, and applies
              both to Haunt.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For her ability array, she wants to be wise and magically powerful
              but not particularly physical. She assigns three pips to {ps}, two
              to {po}, and one to {ph}. Since that makes {ps} associated
              abilities have a max of five pips, she puts five in {cmp} and{" "}
              {ret} and three in {wit}. {ph} associated abilities have a maximum
              of three pips, so she arranges two in each. {po} associated
              abilities have a max of four pips; she puts three in {shv} and{" "}
              {vol} and two in {int}. Finally, she selects {cmp} as her
              specialty, bringing the pip total to six for that ability.
