                        APEX is a tabletop roleplaying game about the Thessians,
                        a race of eldritch beings. As Thessians, the players
                        fight and scheme to bring about their world-spanning
                        plans, whether this involves conquering the universe,
                        building a utopia, or simply exploring the reaches of
                        the unknown. This ruleset encourages narrative-heavy,
                        one-shot style play. You'll need ten ten-sided dice
                        (10d10), a completed character sheet, and somewhere to
                        track your character's resources to participate.

                            A game of APEX involves {bold("players")}, who
                            control {bold("player characters")} ({bold("PCs")}),
                            and a {bold("narrator")} who controls all other
                            characters ({bold("NPCs")}) and sets the scene
                            during play. Typical play cedes decision-making to
                            the players, who determine their PC's actions and
                            what activities to pursue. Given the overwhelming
                            power of the PCs in this game, most actions require
                            no adjudication on the narrator's part and occur
                            without any dice rolls. For instance, should a
                            player want to do something unlikely to
                            fail--ranging anywhere from throwing a rock a few
                            hundred yards to flying, changing their form, or
                            consuming mundane poison--the narrator will give the
                            player the go-ahead to describe the action (or
                            describe it themselves, if the player prefers).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Dice rolls, and APEX's {bold("dice pool")} mechanic,
                            only come into play when a PC attempts an action
                            that has a chance to fail. This may include
                            challenging tasks or actions that another character
                            may contest. To resolve such occurrences, every PC
                            has nine {bold("abilities")} that cover different
                            kinds of actions and three {bold("approaches")}{" "}

                        <p>
                            An approach is how a PC attempts to perform some
                            action. APEX categorizes approaches into three
                            general categories: {primary("Psyche")},{" "}
                            {secondary("Physicality")}, and {accent("Potency")}.
                            A {primary("Psyche")} approach means a PC emphasizes
                            using their mind and forethought, a{" "}
                            {secondary("Physicality")} approach means the PC
                            relies more on their physical body, and a{" "}
                            {accent("Potency")} approach means the PC uses their
                            magic more directly. As an example:{" "}
                            {italic("Tracker")} wants to locate a runaway
                            thrall. If {italic("Tracker")} hid a trace on the
                            thrall before it escaped, she'd use a{" "}
                            {accent("Potency")} approach. If {italic("Tracker")}{" "}
                            went looking for footprints or broken branches, she
                            'd use a {secondary("Physicality")} approach. If{" "}
                            {italic("Tracker")} imagined how the thrall might
                            act and attempted to predict its movements, she 'd
                            use a {primary("Psyche")} approach.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The nine abilities are the broad categories a
                            particular action can fall into and are used to
                            describe the skill a PC has in that kind of action.
                            Abilities are associated with a specific approach in
                            groupings of three per approach.

                        <p>
                            Each approach has one to three pips (â¦¿) associated

                            particular approach--with more pips being better.
                            Similarly, each ability has one to six pips. When a
                            PC attempts to perform an action that might fail (or
                            succeed with consequences), the narrator asks them
                            to perform an ability check. The narrator determines
                            which approach and skill best fit the attempted
                            action and sets the check's difficulty from two to
                            nine. The player rolls a quantity of d10s equal to
                            the approach's pips plus the ability's pips and
                            counts the number of successes: the dice that rolled
                            a six or higher. The action succeeds if the number
                            of successes equals or exceeds the difficulty. If
                            the number of successes is greater than half the
                            difficulty, rounded down, the action partially
                            succeeds or succeeds with consequences. Otherwise,
                            the action fails.

                            Creating a Player Character
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are three steps in creating a player character
                            in APEX: distributing your aptitudes, assigning pips
                            to abilities, and selecting a specialty. First is
                            distributing aptitudes--every player character is
                            excellent at one approach, good at a second
                            approach, and okay at the third approach. Assign
                            three pips to one, two to another, and one to a
                            third. Next is assigning pips to abilities. Each
                            character starts with one pip in every skill, and 18
                            free pips can be assigned to any ability. The
                            maximum number of pips set to any one ability equals
                            two plus the associated approach's number of pips.
                            Finally, select a specialty. Every PC has one
                            ability they're particularly good at. Add one pip
                            onto any skill--this pip ignores the maximum limit
                            from the previous step.
                        </p>

                            character to be wise and magically powerful but not
                            particularly physical. She assigns three pips to{" "}
                            {primary("Psyche")}, two to potency, and one to{" "}
                            {secondary("Physicality")}. Since that makes{" "}
                            {primary("Psyche")}-associated abilities have a max

                            construction of a proper ability array. Begin by
                            dragging the three collections of pips into the
                            approach you wish to assign them to. Then toggle the
                            pips in the ability cards until you've distributed
                            all your points. Finally, select the leftmost pip in
                            the ability you wish to be your PC 's specialty.
